        Loni Graphics formally known as Loni Does Graphics <br>
        is a Junior Designer for Yonder Media  and a freelance graphics designer who is mainly experienced in Print<br>
        Media and Photo manipulation. I have worked with Titan clients (Coke, Nandos, IEC, Legalwise and Tastic to <br>
        name a few). I gladly take on all challenges and thrive under pressure.

        My Motto:<br>
        <b>COLOUR&bull;PHOTOGRAPHY&bull;PASSION&trade;</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm not limited by the present colours, for my creativity looks beyond borders.<br>
        I fell in-love with Adobe Photoshop, ever since then my life has not been the same. I'm also afraid of the dark :)
